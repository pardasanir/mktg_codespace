## Your Name: REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR NAME

### Goal
- Analyze a transportation company's email marketing data set

### Setup
- Edit this starter file. Save the file as Lastname_Firstname_Assignment2.qmd
- Run the following cell.

```{python}
#| echo: TRUE

# Assignment 2

import polars as pl

# Load data as a polars dataframe

email = pl.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numktg/data/main/email.csv")

```

::: {.callout-note}
[Here](https://github.com/numktg/data/blob/main/email_dict.md){target="_blank"} you can find the data dictionary (i.e., definitions of each variable in the transportation data set)
:::

- To answer each assignment question, write your answer using the following format:

```{python}
#| echo: TRUE


# Q1
#
# (your code goes here - remove the # for the lines containing code)
# ...
# ...

```

## Q1: Basic Data Inspection

::: {.callout-note}
Rationale: Before diving deep, marketers need to understand the structure and general content of the data. A preliminary inspection helps to frame subsequent analyses and ensures data quality.
:::

- Use an appropriate function to print the first few rows of the dataset.


. . .

```{python}
# Q1



```



## Q2: Select

1. Based on the `email` data set, select only the following columns: `ID`, `age`, `avg_distance`. Assign these 3 columns to a variable named `customers_basic`.
2. Print the value of `customers_basic`.

. . .

```{python}
# Q2



```




## Q3: Filter

1. Filter the `email` data set to only include customers that are at least 30 years old. Assign this data set to a variable named `customers_30_and_above`.
2. Print `customers_30_and_above`.

. . .

```{python}
# Q3



```



## Q4: Complex Filter

::: {.callout-note}
Rationale: Segmenting customers by age and purchase activity helps marketers identify potentially loyal and high-revenue-generating customer segments.
:::


1. Filter the `email` dataset to only include customers older than 30 and have made more than 5 purchases (`n_purchase`). Save the result to a new variable called `old_frequent_customers`.
2. Print `old_frequent_customers`.

. . .

```{python}
# Q4


```


## Q5 Add New Column
::: {.callout-note}
Rationale: Segmenting customers might involve creating additional columns to better understand their behaviors.
:::


1. Using the `email` data, add a new column named `avg_purchase_value`. This new column should be generated using the formula `total_revenue / n_purchase`. Save the new dataset to a variable named `email_purchases`.
2. Display `email_purchases`.

```{python}



```


## Q6 Summarize Data
::: {.callout-note}
Rationale: analyzing marketing data often involves reporting summary statistics such as mean, max, min.
:::

1. Take the `email` data, compute customers' average `n_purchase`. Use the alias() function to rename the column to `mean_n_purchase`.
2. Compute the minimum `age`. Use the alias() function to rename the column to `min_age`.
3. Compute the sum of `total_revenue`. Use the alias() function to rename the column to `sum_total_revenue`.
    
. . .

```{python}
# Q6


```

## Q7: Summarize data by group
::: {.callout-note}
Rationale: group-specific statistics provide useful information about different customer segments.
:::


1. Group the `email` data set by `success`. Then for each `success` level, compute the average `age`, maximum `n_purchase`, and, median `total_revenue`. Make sure summary columns are called `average_age`, `max_n_purchase`, and `median_total_revenue`, respectively.

. . .

```{python}
# Q7


```
